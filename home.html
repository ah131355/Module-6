  <p align="center">Ap Spanish is a class at West High School taught by Barbara Lipnick. It focuses on writing, speaking, understanding and comprehending the spanish language. <br>
  You can take this class after completing years 1-4 of
  spanish to improve your spanish vocabulary and get more practice of using the language.This is a step up from other spanish classes here at West because there is a lot more
  independent work and it's up to you to be responsible enough to learn. </p>
