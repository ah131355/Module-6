  <p align="center"> AP spanish is a wonderful class! The course is only run once a year so make sure you sign up as soon as possible or you could miss out on this opportunity. It is a three term class that is worth 0.5 credit each quarter. Materials you need include the
     AP Spanish workbook which you will have to pay for, and you will also be checked out a textbook that you'll return at
     the end of the year. The workbook focuses on four different activities. </p>
